# panama-gl

This project explore Native OpenGL capabilities of Panama Early-Access Release as candidate to complement JOGL and ensure JOGL's future on JDK>17.

JDK 17 incubation comes with [JEP-412 : Foreign Function & Memory API](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/412) which offers a brand new way of accessing native libraries.

We here show how to use Panama to generate an OpenGL bindings for standalone application as well as for [Jzy3D](https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api), which already uses JOGL for GPU rendering and EmulGL for CPU rendering.

## Demos

### 3D offscreen GL demo

* `TestFBO_macOS` and `DemoFBO_Offscreen_macOS`

More details in [demo index](doc/PanamaGL-Demos.md)

### 3D onscreen GL demos
These two demo open a *native* window with Jzy3D (hence not a Java window yet). One can use the mouse to rotate the object, and double click to start an automatic rotation.

## Panama GL Design

The design of the library is defined [here](doc/PanamaGL-Design.md) but roughly described in the schema below.

## OpenGL Wrappers, Bindings, Natives

Let's clarify 3 words
* _Natives_ : native OpenGL libraries (`opengl.dll`, `libGL.dylib`, `libGL.so` with related `GL.h`). Up to now assumed to be available on developer computer.
* _Bindings_ : raw Java classes generated by `JExtract` to invoke _Native_ libraries. Precompiled, available on Maven, Stored [here](https://gitlab.com/jzy3d/panama-gl-bindings).
* _Wrappers_ : thin Java abstraction to fit a common GL interface defined by `panama-gl-core/GL`, wrapping _Bindings_.

This project only provides _Wrappers_ and depends on _Bindings_. This avoid the main projects to recompile large _Bindings_ file source folder and makes IDEs faster.

### Existing Wrappers & Bindings

| Binding | Platform | GPU | Branch |
| ------- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| Linux | Ubuntu 20 | Intel | in progress / Blocked by FBO on Ubuntu |
| Apple | macOS 10.15.7 | Intel | OK |
| Apple | macOS 11.4.0 M1 | M1 | in progress / Blocked by no Panama JDK on ARM yet (Oracle) |
| Microsoft | Windows 10 | Intel | in progress / Blocked by JDK19 |

### Building OpenGL bindings for your platform

To generate new bindings for your platform, see [the setup documentation of the bindings project](https://gitlab.com/jzy3d/panama-gl-bindings/-/tree/main/doc/setup)

* You _should_ only have to do this if you use a computer OS and version for which binding exist already.
* You _may not_ have to regenerate bindings for your OS if its version is supported by existing OS bindings at other versions
